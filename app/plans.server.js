// Plan tier catalog + resolution.
//
// This app is a Shopify "Managed Pricing" app: the actual plans (and their real
// prices/trials) are created in the Partner Dashboard, and a merchant subscribes
// to one on Shopify's hosted pricing page. The app cannot create charges; its job
// is to read the *name* of the merchant's active subscription and map it to the
// tier defined here — which decides the monthly image quota and which features
// are unlocked.
//
// IMPORTANT: the plan names below (and their "<name> Annual" variants) MUST match
// the plan names created in the Partner Dashboard exactly, because tier resolution
// is by name. `getPlanByName` normalizes case and a trailing " Annual" and falls
// back to the Free tier for unknown / missing names.

// Feature flags used for gating. Features that exist in the app today: optimize,
// webp, altText, pageSpeed, autoOptimize. The rest are declared now so future
// features only need their flag flipped + UI built.
