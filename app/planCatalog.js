// Client-safe pricing display catalog (marketing copy + prices) for the pricing
// page and pricing wall. The source of truth for runtime gating/quotas is
// plans.server.js — keep the prices/quotas here in sync with that file and with
// the plans created in the Partner Dashboard.
//
// Note: because this is a Managed Pricing app, every "Choose plan" button sends
// the merchant to Shopify's hosted pricing page where they pick the real plan —
// the per-tier buttons here are purely informational about what they'll get.
